### This meeting
* First draft of plan-report?
> Before Thursday 22:00


### Until next meeting
> If we are done and need feedback on the plan-report to contine writing, we could start talking about implementation

> Otherwise, write on the plan report

### Meeting with the handler
> We need to establish more iterations with specifics. 

> We need goals on our plan-report which we will then transfer to our final report

> We are not creating anything world-changing, tone down the "change all communication"

> We need to be able to explaint what we are doing better. We need to have clear goals, clear specifications, clear everything.
