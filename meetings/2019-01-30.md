*** Notes from the meeting  with robin *** 

Start with a small example.
If child want to send private information. Then parent has needed to send consent. And parent has to have seen it. 

The parent "NEEDS" the policy to "SIGN" the concent. It's a public key problem.

A protocol or a format, to have a signed something. That means that we need to send a message, that the parent has to sign with his key. 
And when the child has received the parents concent and websitedata, the child will send it's data and the website will decode it. 

They can see the start and endpoints of the nodes. If a third party checks. 


The tokens of the parent and child is public for the first version.


Maybe a third party that verifies if the child is connected to the parent. 

Extended: Parent has to send the childid encrypted.
