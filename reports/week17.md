### Weekly reports
### 2019-05-13 -> 2019-06-19

* #### Joel
Documented, booked rooms, updated the calender and spent most of my time writing on the report and tried to get the external third-party to work. 

* #### Robert
I wrote for the report, mostly about our design and implementation decisions in chapters Method and Result. I also wrote a couple of chapter and section introductions where I related our text to the theory of Adams and Schupp. This was done in an attempt to strengthen common threads and themes in the text, and to that end I also restructured it a bit.

* #### Adi
Attended some meetings but spent the majority of my time on finalizing the report.

* #### Fredrik

* #### Johan

### What we have done
