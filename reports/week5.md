### Weekly reports
### 2019-02-18 -> 2019-02-24

* #### Joel
Attended all meetings. Secretaity work and documenting. Reading about different libraries. Been coding on my own to try to understand the poco library. Time spent: 23hours.

* #### Robert

After deciding to start out the project in C++, I spent the first couple of days reading a book on the language. I did some networking tutorials for C++ and started to look into different network libraries, including Boost.Asio and Poco. I wrote a simple client/server application using sys/socket. After deciding with the group to use the Poco libraries, I spent a lot of time just to make it work properly. When I finally succeeded, I wrote some Poco applications and started to play around with them in Mininet. Then I ran Poco applications with different network topologies. I had the idea that if all traffic on the network went through a common switch, then I could run a packet sniffer there, as a basis for our third-party observer. I found this setup with Mininet convenient and decided to suggest to the group that we use it.

* #### Adi
Read up on C++ along with the necessary libraries for the project. Did mostly coding for the rest of the week to get familiar with the C++ language and package managers. Contacted the group were opposing(?) and exchanged planning reports.

* #### Fredrik

* #### Johan

### What we have done
Made a lot of desicions. We discussed about how the workflow is going to be. Decided it will be done with git's project tab. Using our own implementation of scrum. We also decided that our first implementation would be using poco libraries. We will probably also use conan, to handle the required packages. We had a crash course in how to use git properly and booked a time for the first "Handledartillf√§lle".

### Preperations before next week
Get familiar with poco.
