### What we have done
Made a lot of desicions. We discussed about how the workflow is going to be. Decided it will be done with git's project tab. Using our own implementation of scrum. We also decided that our first implementation would be using poco libraries. We will probably also use conan, to handle the required packages. We had a crash course in how to use git properly and booked a time for the first "Handledartillf√§lle".

### Preperations before next week
Get familiar with poco.
