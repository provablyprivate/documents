### Weekly reports
### 2019-02-25 -> 2019-03-03

* #### Joel
Did all the secretairy work. Booked rooms. Prepared before info-meeting and "handledningstillfälle". I also co-created the halftime-presentation and worked on it. 
* #### Robert
Most of my time this week was spent on preparing for two meetings we had on Friday: the Infolabb at the library, and the Fackspråk meeting with another project group. For the former, I looked over the sources in our planning report and discussed them with the group, and for the latter I read the other group's planning report and prepared feedback with my group. On the meetings, we received useful information regarding the handling of sources, e.g. how to properly cite them, and some valuable feedback on the structure of our planning report. Additionally, I participated in preparing our half-time presentation and studied C++ some more. I did no actual work on our project, though.

* #### Adi
Took on the responsibility to be one of the two people who will represent our group during the half-time presentation. All my time has gone to working on things related to this: Constructing a power point, discussing relevant issues to talk about, creating a manusscript, and preparing verbally at home.

### What we have done
This week we attended the two obligatory meetings where we received feedback on our planning-report and another meeting where we received more information regarding sources and how to handle them. We began working on our half-time presentation and decided that Joel and Adi will handle the halftime-presentation. Little to no work has been done on the actual product, since all of our attention is towards the presentation and the meetings.
