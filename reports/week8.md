### Weekly reports
### 2019-03-11 -> 2019-03-17

* #### Joel
Coded on my parts. Documented the neccessary stuff. Booked rooms and attended meetings. 
* #### Robert
Designed and programmed a general interface for managing TCP connections to remote hosts. This included abstractions for setup, teardown, and writing to and reading from the associated sockets. The purpose was to abstract away from low-level details, to prevent blocking socket reads from making agents passive, and to provide a uniform way of sending and receiving data.
* #### Adi
Continued to do my part of the coding. Ask and got permission from the rest of the group to take a week off due to upcoming exams. Agreed to attend the meetings with the supervisor, not however the scheduled group meetings.
