### What we have done
This week all we have done really is work on the planning-report. This is because the deadline was this friday and this is an important part of the project.

### Preperations before next week
Nothing really, next week we will start working on the actual product. Since the planning-report is done and the next part is the haft-time demonstration and we need something to show.
