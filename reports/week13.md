### Weekly reports
### 2019-04-15 -> 2019-04-21

* #### Joel
Created graphics for the messages passing between the Agens and how the network topology is visualized.. Wrote more on results and method.. Documented and booked rooms. 

* #### Robert
I worked on the simulation - took part in writing, testing and debugging code. Once all semantics of our sequential test program were incorporated, I sorted out software dependencies of the simulation and wrote some build instructions. When the simulation was running properly, I began fine-tuning it and added some usage options.

* #### Adi
Finished up the last of the code. Most of the logic should done finished. Sent some emails back and forth to the examiner regarding the report and hardware.

* #### Fredrik

* #### Johan

### What we have done
Almost done with all the code. Interfaces is done. The composition of code is done. Working on a easy runnable script to install everything and show a nice simulation.
