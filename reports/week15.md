* #### Joel
Configured our local network for the presentation. Installed software for the pies. Wrote on the report.

* #### Robert
I fixed a bug in our Third Party application, and implemented some changes we had discussed in order to make the simulation conform better to the paper. This included some renaming of the types, and a use of signatures where previously there were none. Later in the week, I started working on the final report. I looked into POCO's RSA implementation (probabilistic) and its security properties. I started writing about implementation decisions we have made.

* #### Adi
Spent most of my time installing and configuring software on the RP's. Set up IP specific connections to the RP's for easier access. Started writing on the report.
