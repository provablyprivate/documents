Attended one of the group meetings (I was ill during the other) and the meeting with the supervisor and started writing the plan report.

Coordinated a meeting with Robin to clarify our projects purpose and our actual role in it. Discussed possible implementations together with the group.

We also started the discussion about what programming language we should choose for the project, but didn't settle on anyting particular.
