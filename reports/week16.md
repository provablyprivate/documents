### Weekly reports
### 2019-05-06 -> 2019-06-12

* #### Joel
Documented, booked rooms, updated the calender, wrote on the report, created the demo files so that we can run both the safe and unsafe architecture. 

* #### Robert
I wrote for the report. Mostly, I focused on the introduction and tried to create a common thread in the text. I also tried to balance the level of detail of the review of the method. If a reader gets a feel as to how it works, it should be enough.

* #### Adi
Wrote on the report all week. Mostly focused on the Result section. Did some  work on the Method section as well. Also attended the obligatory half time meeting.
* #### Fredrik

* #### Johan

### What we have done
Kept working with the report. Worked with the demofiles to make sure we can show both the safe and unsafe architecture.
