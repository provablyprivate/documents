### What we have done
This week we continued to work on our individual parts. Joel and Johan worked on the report meanwhile Adi and Robert continued working on the code. The code will soon be done, only a few interfaces is now missing and a few bugs are left. We decided to encode our messages hex.hex instead of our old version. The report is coming along nicely, we have written a lot in the results and method parts now and are up to ~9 pages of text. 

We also had a meeting with Robin where we discussed what we have done and he was very happy with the results.
