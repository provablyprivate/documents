### Weekly reports
### 2019-04-01 -> 2019-04-07

* #### Joel
Managed the calender and deadlines, booked rooms, set up meetings, documented and wrote on the method in the final paper. 

* #### Robert
I worked on our simulation. I set up an "unsafe" architecture (Fig. 1 in the paper by Adams and Schupp), to serve as the basis when we were to incorporate the type system we had been working with. This setting up involved writing agent code where the agents handle their initial types, writing a Python script using the Mininet API for creating a network emulation, and writing code for a third party that intercepts (and, at this point, just prints) all traffic on the emulated network. I also attended the second Fackspråk meeting, as well as the regular meetings with the group.

* #### Adi
Created a final version of our demo file that will be presented to Robin next week. Focused mostly on improving code, updating the core functions of our JSON class. Began translating the demo code to actual practical code for our mininet. Sent out an order for the hardware that's being used on the final presentation. Coordinated aboved mentioned meeting with Robin. Attended the second obligatory course meeting.

### What we have done
Had the second "handledningstillfälle" and received feedback from the report. We divided the work to focus more on the report. We managed to implement a working RSA encryptin/decryption method. 
### Preperations before next week
Keep working on our individual parts. (Writing on the report, fix the signing trace, interfaces)
